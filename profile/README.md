## [Post Quantum Qoin](https://qoins.me) 👋
🙋‍♀️ Qoin is a **decentralized quantum-resistant AI supercomputing network** that uses multiple [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) standard Post-quantum algorithms as the underlying signature algorithm to ensure that blockchain assets are not affected by quantum computer attacks.  
  
Based on decentralized network storage technology, modular design, and virtual machine technology, Qoin provides general storage and general computing services to provide a basic computing power platform for AI.
